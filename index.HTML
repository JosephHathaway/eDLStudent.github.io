    <h1>Joseph Hathaway</h1>

    <p>I have great work ethics like promptness, communication skills, 
and have pride in what I do. I will listen, continue to learn, and have 
initiative. My best project is my B.E.A.R.S Poster Project which I made for my school. 
I have two years of web devlopment experience with a strong knowledge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, knowledge of the 
agile method, Bootstrap, and an academic excellence award in web development.</p> 

<p>Do you need a star athlete to win state in Cross Country? My hypothesis is that the answer would be yes, that a 
star athlete would elevate the team around them leading to a victory.<span id="dots">..</span><span id="more"> The 
data I will be using is all based out of Alaska, out of division one, and the last 20 years. I will be able to find the
athletes personal record(PR) the competing athletes PRs, calculate their average time, and the same for the second 
and third place teams. From my three years experiece of running Cross Country for the Kodiak Bears I have corbributed 
to all three of the state races two as a scorer. The highest Kodaik has gotten was fifth and that was with Micah Fields 
as our fastest runner. Did that team do better because of Micah or because of a better team?</span></p>
